TypeScript is a Strongly Typed Language.
TypeScript needs type specification.

JavaScript is a Loosely Type Language.
or weakly typed.

Strongly Typed can be either
statically or dynamically typed.

TS statically typed,
so cek di compile time.

JS dynamically typed,
so data types check on run time.

TS benefits:
- Self-documenting. ???
- Catch Errors in dev.
- Great for teams. ???
